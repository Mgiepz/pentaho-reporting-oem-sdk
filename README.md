pentaho-reporting-oem-sdk
=========================

A extended SDK containing samples for OEMs


1. "sample-use-lightweight"

This is a simple example on how to use the Pentaho Reporting engine
in an embedded scenario. It shows how to show a Swing-preview dialog
and also shows how to export to a PDF file without any GUI.

This sample provides a ready to use, minimal runtime configuration
that does not include the Pentaho Data Integration, Mondrian or OLAP4J
data-sources. The projects footprint is 30MB.


2. "sample-use-full"

This is a simple example on how to use the Pentaho Reporting engine
in an embedded scenario. It shows how to show a Swing-preview dialog
and also shows how to export to a PDF file without any GUI.

This sample provides a full runtime configuration that is equivalent
to the configuration used in the Pentaho Report Designer. It contains
all data-sources, including the Pentaho Data Integration, Mondrian and
OLAP4J data-sources. The project footprint is 120MB.


3. "sample-module"

This SDK module shows how to create a extension module for the Pentaho
Reporting engine. Extension modules form the basis of all extensions
and help you to inject your code into the reporting engine in a controlled
and safe way.
