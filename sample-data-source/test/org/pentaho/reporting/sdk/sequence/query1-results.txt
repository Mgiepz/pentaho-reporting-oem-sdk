The sushi was fresh and very tasty. I like the variety in the menu and the presentation of the food was a nice amenity. I was a little disappointed with the ambiance. Not a bad thing, I thought it would be a little bit more lively and crowded, but instead of it was more quiet than I thought. Which wasnt a bad thing, since my friend and I didnt have to wait for a table and could hear each other talk. Overall, I would recommend this place, but I little bit overrated, I thought reading from the other reviewers.}'

I live 1 block away. It was convenient and the sushi is good. We always tolerated the bad service and the attitude. Of the 100 times weve been, weve probably had good service 20% of the time. Despite the frequency of our patronage we rarely got recognized by the staff and OFTEN waited 20-25 minutes (or more) for drink orders, the check, etc... and the attitude and aloofness was palpable. The last time I went I sat at the bar and a male bartender clearly seemed annoyed with us for no reason at all. We begged for drinks, opened our own Sake bottle (not twist off - corkscrew), and were pretty much ignored all night long - right down to waiting FOREVER for our bill. I told my friends "this is the last time...." Its embarrassing to bring in guests from out of town. I eat out 99% of the time and they have the worst service I have ever consistently experienced.Do yourself a favor go to nearby Live Sushi Bar or Sushi Bistro and be waited on by people who smile with no attitude. The sushi at both places is excellent too.and Blowfish...get over yourself.dont dont, dont, dont...dont believe the hype.....Chris B}'

Eric and Sonny make you feel so welcome. The hand rolls are great and so are the specialty rolls. If you like deep fried rolls, try Erics specialty. Also great recommendation is the butter fish sashimi. It goes down so smooth. Sit at the sushi bar for a fun time. The interior is very inviting. A definite must try!}'
